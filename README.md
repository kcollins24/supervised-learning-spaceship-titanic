# supervised-learning-spaceship-titanic
Coursework for IBM's Machine Learning Professional Certificate course. Dataset from Kaggle; the goal is to predict which passengers were transported off a spaceship or not.

The final project report contains a report on the data, and a summary of how the models I trained performed.

Kaggle is a website which hosts 'competitions' for machine learning. The code which is labeled 'final_prediction' is for submitting predictions to the competition. The script which is just 'prediction' is
for data exploration and training various different models. It generates the figures and data which go into the report.
